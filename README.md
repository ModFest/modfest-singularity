- Witness the dawn of 83 mods, including **Switchy**, **Blast Travel**, **Kahur**, **Scarves**, and **Whipdashing**!
- Explore an interdimensional mall full of mod "booths" around every corner!
- Jump around on the playground, blast between plazas, and traverse the wall-to-wall chunk-sized shops!
- Find and earn up to 108 collectible strawberries, hidden all across the map by participants!
- Haul merchandise around and show it off, and discover the eerie abandoned "cake mall"....
- *Get in loser, we're going shopping!*
